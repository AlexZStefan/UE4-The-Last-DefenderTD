# UE4-The-Last-DefenderTD

3D Demo project made with Unreal Engine 4.

2 level game where player has to build towers on specific spots around the map in order to defend against the incoming zombie horde attacking the players` village. 

Player can move around using W A S D, run faster by pressing shift and jump by pressing space.

Player has to avoid zombies otherwise, if too close, the zombies will attack the player. 

Player has the ability to shoot fireballs that will make the enemy catch fire, damaging them overtime. 

Killing enemies will generate coins which player can spend by building towers.

Player can place 3 types of towers. Normal(best in game damage), Fire (over time damage), Ice (slow). 

Player can sell the towers and upgrade them up to level 3, where the towers attack and speed will be increased with each upgrade. 

Player can also collect coins (from 2nd level) to be able to buy more towers and upgrades.

Towers will automatically shoot the enemy targets, unless towers are damaged, where player has to sell them and rebuild.

Implemented collision on zombies so that attacks will trigger only when the zombies are playing the attack animation.
